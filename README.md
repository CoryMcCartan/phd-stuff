# Stuff I Wish I'd Known Earlier in My Ph.D.

There's a lot more learning that goes on in a Ph.D. than just the formal coursework.
This website collects some of the accumulated wisdom of current and past Ph.D. students.

### [**Submit tips, tricks, and advice here &raquo;**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZkPa7OP-KASLGYcHvTQ8MxTlzibv8XRtkKjyajptMtZv-jQ/viewform)

## How the Website Works

Individual tips and bits of advice are submitted at the form above.
Submissions are then screened and assigned a title.
The script `R/00_build.R` then can be run to generate a Quarto website collating all the advice.

Some submissions may be Harvard-specific.
These are not made public; instead, they are encrypted.
Viewers have to provide the decryption key in order to read these pages.
